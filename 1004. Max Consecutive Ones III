Hint
Given a binary array nums and an integer k, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array if you can flip at most k 0's.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], k = 3
Output: 10
Explanation: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
nums[i] is either 0 or 1.
0 <= k <= nums.length


class Solution:
    def longestOnes(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        if not nums:
            return 0
        
        left_ptr =0
        max_length = 0
        zero_count = 0

        for right_ptr in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[right_ptr] ==0:
                zero_count +=1
            
            while zero_count >k:
                if nums[left_ptr]==0:
                    zero_count -=1
                left_ptr +=1
            
            max_length = max(right_ptr-left_ptr+1,max_length)
        
        return max_length

        # Time complexity: O(n)
        # Space compelxity: O(1)
